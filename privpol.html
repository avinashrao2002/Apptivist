Privacy Policy
Cofounders Avinash Rao & Ruchir Baronia, hereby referred to as “THE CREATORS”, built the Apptivism platform. This SERVICE is provided by “THE CREATORS” at no cost and is intended for use as is.
 
This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.
If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Apptivism: Create Real Change unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
 
Liability to “THE CREATORS”
THE CREATORS assume no personal liability for any damage, or misuse of, Apptivism. This privacy policy outlines not only the occasions in which Apptivism, as a platform, is not liable for privacy issues, but also means THE CREATORS must not be held liable for any conditions outlined in this document.
 
Publicity of Posts, Events, & Profile
By default, all accounts created through Apptivism, and all content associated with such respective accounts—including, but not limited to, username, posts, events, images, profile picture, bio, full name, email address, are made public for anyone—either in or outside of the platform—to view.
 
Additionally, by signing up for events through the app (marking oneself as “interested” or “going”), the user understands and authorizes the disclosure of their email address to the event creator, and authorizes them to initiate communication with them via email.
 
Information Collection and Use
For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to Name, Email, Location. The information that we request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
 
The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

Service Providers
I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
To facilitate our Service;

I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
 
Security
We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.
